<p>Congratulations, you finally arrived at one of the most technical parts of the book. Keep that in mind in case you get lost.</p>
<p>The Blender game engine was once famous for letting you create a full game without touching a single piece of code. Although this may sound attractive,
it also leads to a very limited game-making experience. Logic bricks, as presented in Chapter 3, are very handy for quick prototyping. However, once you need
to access advanced resources, external libraries and devices, or simply optimize your application, a programming language becomes your new best friend.</p>
<p>Through the use of a scripting language called <strong>Python</strong>, the game engine (as Blender itself) is fully extensible. This programming language is easy to learn,
although extremely powerful. Be aware, though, that you will not find a complete guide to learning Python here. There are plenty of resources online and offline
that will serve you better. However, even if you are not inclined to study Python deeply now, sooner or later you will find yourself struggling with script files.
So, it’s important to know what you are dealing with.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><strong>Yes, You Can</strong></p>
<p>For those experienced Python programmers (or for those catching up with the reference learning material),
always remember: if you can do something with Python, chances are, you can do it in the game engine.</p>
</div>
<p>After the brief overview in the Python basics, we will explain how to apply your knowledge of Python inside the game engine. You’ll also learn
how to access the Python methods, properties, and objects you’ll be using.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-script-when-you-can-logic-brick-it">
<h2>Why Script When You Can Logic Brick It?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-script-when-you-can-logic-brick-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We can compare logic bricks with real bricks. On the one hand, we have strong elements on which to build our system, but, on the other hand, we have a
system as flexible as a blind wall.</p>
<p>There are many occasions when the same effect can be achieved in different ways. Different phases of the production may also require varied
workflows. The reason for picking a particular method is often personal. Nevertheless, we present here a few arguments that may convince you to crack a
good Python book and start learning more about it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sane replacement for large-scale logic-bricked objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Better handling of multiple objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to Blender’s advanced features.</p></li>
<li><p>Use features that are not part of Blender.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep track of your changes with a version control system.</p></li>
<li><p>Debug your game while it runs.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><strong>Logic Brick, the Necessary Good</strong></p>
<p>You can’t ever get away from logic bricks. Even when using Python exclusively for your game, you will need to invoke the scripts from a Python controller.
The ideal is to find the balance that fits your project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sane-replacement-for-large-scale-logic-bricked-objects">
<h2>Sane Replacement for Large-Scale Logic-Bricked Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#sane-replacement-for-large-scale-logic-bricked-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It’s always good to have an excuse to show an image in a programming chapter, and here it is. In Figure 7.1 you see the logic bricks for Frankie,
the main character of the open game <strong>Yo Frankie!</strong></p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id1">
<img alt="../../_images/Fig07-01.png" src="../../_images/Fig07-01.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Chapagetti</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>This system is well organized: different actions belong to different states and sensors; controllers and actuators are properly named.
Nevertheless, it’s not hard to lose yourself trying to understand which sensor connects to which controller. One of the reasons for such a complex
project to rely on logic bricks is because <strong>Yo Frankie!</strong> serves as a didactic project for artists wanting to start with the game engine. Anyone with a
little programming experience can take the files and expand the game freely. (Have you tried it yet?)</p>
<p>However, you often aim for performance and workflow. Having everything centralized in a single script file can save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>Another important aspect while working is to document your project. It’s easy to open a file only a few months old and find yourself completely lost.
Script files, on the other hand, are naturally structured to be self-documented. To document logic bricks, you need to rely on text files inside or outside
your Blender files (and neat image diagrams). It’s definitively not as handy as inline comments along your code. (Code diagrams can still be useful, but
that’s a different topic.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="better-handling-of-multiple-objects">
<h2>Better Handling of Multiple Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#better-handling-of-multiple-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Big projects lead to multiple files, this is an inevitable truth. Even when you use external linking and libraries, it’s crucial to optimize
the time spent in changing multiple sets at once. This is one of the weaknesses of logic bricks, they make it hard to automatically change
a big range of elements at the same time.</p>
<p>If you need to change a property name or initial value of an object, you will need to repeat that change in other instances of the same. We have ways
to make it easier by using copy and paste of logic bricks/properties between objects or even through logic sharing. Nevertheless, you will still have
to update all the Property sensors, controllers, and actuators that may rely on the old value. That’s especially true for objects with logic bricks
across them, as we saw, the game engine allows you to link logic bricks from different objects. However, self-contained objects/logic bricks are easier
to work with (and with less spaghetti).</p>
<p>If you thought that Figure 7.1 was a mess, try to make sense of Figure 7.2. Here we have the logic bricks of <strong>Frankie</strong>, plus the objects that have logic bricks
connected to it. As you recall, you can restrict the visible logics through the Show Panel option, but this illustrates how difficult it is to get a global view of your system.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id2">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Spaghetti</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>Once you start to work with scripts, you will see how easy it is to assume control over all your scene elements in a global way. It will give you lots of benefits in the long run.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-to-blender-s-advanced-features">
<h2>Access to Blender’s Advanced Features<a class="headerlink" href="#access-to-blender-s-advanced-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will be happy to know that the game engine has a powerful set of features beyond those found in the logic brick’s interface. Also, almost all
the functionality found in the logic bricks can be accomplished through an equivalent method of the game engine API (which will be covered in the
section “Using the Game Engine API - Application Programming Interface”). The API ranges from tasks that could be performed with logic bricks, such
as to change a property in a sensor or to completely remove an object from the game, all the way to functionality not available otherwise, such as
playing videos and network connection.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><strong>We Never Forget the First Patch</strong></p>
<p>The ability to directly end an object from Python was introduced in Blender 2.47. This is a good example of how convenient script methods can be.
And here comes a bit of history … back in August 2008, the project we were working on, OceanViz (read more about it in the Case Studies in Chapter 10),
required a huge amount of objects to dynamically pop up and die. The game engine simulation had critical performance issues, and optimization was not a luxury
there. At that point, we had reduced ending objects by having a simple Property sensor that would trigger an Edit Object <strong></strong> EndObject actuator. So far, so good.
However, one extra sensor running every frame for every single object in the scene was costing us some performance we could use elsewhere. (We are talking about
hundreds of objects here.)
When blaming our software didn’t help (it may eventually), it was time to get our hands dirty. After some hard work and some online help,
we had our first patched version of Blender game engine working right in front of us. We didn’t need those multiple sensors anymore because a simple <strong>myobjects.endObject()</strong>
was doing the job now. (Where is the champagne?)
To be allowed to extend our own version of Blender in that way was cool. To submit the patch and have it implemented in the core of Blender was memorable.</p>
</div>
<p>There are a few reasons for not having all the methods accessible through logic bricks. First, a graphic interface is very limited for complex coding.
You may end up with a slow system that is far from optimized. Second, having methods independent from the interface allows it to be expanded more easily
and constantly (from a development point of view). Some advanced features, such as mirroring system, dynamic load of meshes, OpenGL calls, and custom constraints
would hardly fit in the current Blender game engine interface. They would probably end up not being implemented because of the amount of extra work required. Other
things you will find in the game engine built-in methods are: make screenshots; change world settings (gravity, logic tic rates); access the returned data from sensors
(pressed keys, mouse position); change object properties (camera lens, light colors, object mass); and many others we will cover in the course of this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-features-that-are-not-part-of-blender">
<h2>Use Features That Are Not Part of Blender<a class="headerlink" href="#use-features-that-are-not-part-of-blender" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No man is an island. No game is an island either (except <strong>Monkey Island</strong>). And the easiest way to integrate your Blender game with the exterior
world is with Python. If you want to use external devices to control the game input or to tie external applications to your game, you may find Python suitable for that task.</p>
<p>Here are some examples that showcase what can be done with Python external libraries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Grab data off the Internet for game score.</p></li>
<li><p>Control your game with a Nintendo Wiimote controller.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine Head-tracking and immersive displays for augmented reality.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those possibilities go with the previous statement that almost everything that you can do with Python, you can do in the game engine. And since Python can
be used with modules written in other languages (properly wrapped), you can virtually use any application as a basis for your system.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><strong>Cross-Platform, Yes; Cross-Version, Not</strong></p>
<p>To use external libraries, you must know the Python version they were built against. The Python library you are using must be compatible with the
Python version that comes with your Blender. It’s also valuable to check how often the library is updated and if it will be maintained in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keep-track-of-your-changes-with-a-version-control-system">
<h2>Keep Track of Your Changes with a Version Control System<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-track-of-your-changes-with-a-version-control-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you take a Blender file in two different moments of your production, you will have a hard time finding what has changed between them. This is because Blender’s
native file format is a binary type. Binary files are written in a way that you can’t get to them directly, they are designed to be accessed by programs and not by human beings.</p>
<p>Scripts, on the other hand, are plain text files. You can open a script in any text editor and immediately see the differences between two similar files. Finding those
differences are vital to going forward and backward with your experimentations during work. Actually, if you don’t want to check for differences manually, you may want
to consider using external script files with a version control system such as Git, SVN, Mercury, or CVN.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><strong>And the Catch Is …</strong></p>
<p>This works only for scripts maintained outside Blender. This is one of the strong reasons to prefer Python Module controllers as opposed to Python Script controllers.</p>
</div>
<p>A version control system allows you to move between working versions of your project files. It makes it relatively safe to experiment with different
methods in a destructive way. In other words, it’s a system to protect you from yourself. In Figure 7.3, you can see an application of this. Someone changed
the script file online while we were working locally on it. Instead of manually tracking down the differences, we could use a tool to merge both changes into
a new file and commit it. We were using TortoiseSVN for Windows here, a graphic interface to use with a SVN system. For Linux systems, svn command-line plus
the software “meld” work just as well.</p>

<h2>Debug Your Game While It Runs<a class="headerlink" href="#debug-your-game-while-it-runs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Interpreted languages (also known as scripting languages) are slower than compiled code. Therefore, to speed up their performance they are
precompiled and cached the first time they run (when you launch your game). This is not mandatory, though, and if you are using external Python scripts
(instead of those created inside Blender), you can use the debugging button to have them reloaded every time they are called.</p>
<p>In Figure 7.4, we have the scripts.reload_me module that will be reloaded every frame. That way you can dynamically change the content of your scripts,
variables, and functions without having to restart the game. Try it yourself: copy the content of the folder BookChapter71_reloadme to your computer
and launch debug_python.blend. Play your game, and you will see a spinning cube. The speed of the cube is controlled by the 14th line of the file script.py,
found in the same folder.</p>

<p>Without closing Blender or even stopping your game, open the file script.py in a text editor, change this line to 0.05, for example, and save it.
You will see the speed changing immediately. Your game is literally being updated at runtime, and you can change any module that’s been called with the debug option on.</p>

<h2>So What Exactly Is Python?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-what-exactly-is-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that you are aware of all the benefits of using Python, it’s time to understand what Python is. Once again, we can’t go over all the aspects of the language here. Nevertheless,
a general overview is still desirable to help you understand the examples presented in this book.</p>
<p>To study your scripts, you must be aware of the following aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Flexible data types</p></li>
<li><p>Indentation</p></li>
<li><p>OOP, Object-Oriented Programming</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="flexible-data-types">
<h2>Flexible Data Types<a class="headerlink" href="#flexible-data-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you write a program, you have to use variables to store changing values at runtime. Unlike languages such as C and Java, Python variables are
very flexible: they can be declared on the fly when you first use them; you can assign different data types for the same variable; and you can even name them dynamically:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="n">exec</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;var\_</span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2"> = </span><span class="si">%d</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">))</span>

<p>As you can see, the variable names are created at runtime. Therefore, if you name your objects correctly in the Blender file, you can store them in
variables named after them. The following code snip assigns the scene objects (retrieved from the game engine) to variables named after their names.</p>

<p>Although we have flexible data types, we must respect variable types while manipulating and passing/returning them to functions. Here you can see a list
of the data types you will find in the Blender game engine API:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Integer:</strong> This is the most common of the numerical types. It can store any number that fits in your computer memory. You can perform any regular math operations on it, such as sum, subtraction, division, modulus, and potency.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>List:</strong> A list contains a conjunct of elements ordered by ascending indexes.

<li><p><strong>String:</strong> Whenever you need to store a text, you will use strings. As words are a combination of individual letters, a string consists of individual characters.

<div class="section" id="indentation">
<h2>Indentation<a class="headerlink" href="#indentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Indentation, the amount of white spaces or tabs you leave before a new line.</p>
<p>When coding in a particular programming language, it’s mandatory to follow its general syntax. In that regard, Python is one of the most restricted languages out there.
Think of this as a tough grammar exam. You won’t be able to score high unless you follow all the pre-established grammar rules. Now imagine that it could be even worse,
as bad as a written legal document. We are talking about strict paragraphs, indentation, information hierarchy, and similar rules.</p>
<p>As in a legal document, those rules have a raison d’etrê. With strict form/syntax, you can focus more on the content of the text.
And ambiguity in the context of code making is fatal.</p>
<p>Indentation is the most important aspect of Python syntax. Python code uses the indentation level to define where loops, functions, and general nesting start/end.
Take a look at this example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">here_i_am</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="c1"># definition of the first function</span>

<span class="mi">2</span>     <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m inside the first function.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="mi">3</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m outside the function.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="mi">4</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">but_I</span><span class="s1">&#39;m_not_here(): # definition of the second function</span>

<span class="mi">5</span>     <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;For you can&#39;t see me!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="mi">6</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;m still outside the function.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="mi">7</span> <span class="n">here_i_am</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># calling the first function</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here we are defining a function (1–2), calling a built-in print function (3), defining another function (4–5), calling another built-in print function (6),
and finally calling the first function we declared (7).</p>
<p>The output of such script will be:</p>
<p><cite>I’m outside the function.</cite>
<cite>I’m still outside the function.</cite>
<cite>I’m inside the first function.</cite></p>
<p>The first thing you may notice is that Python runs from top to bottom. Therefore, you must define your function before you call it. Secondly, you can see that the second
function is never called. So how can the code interpreter determine which print statements to call? The answer is: indentation! Whenever you change the indentation level
(lines 1–2, 2–3, 4–5, and 5–6), you determine the hierarchical relation between the elements. Therefore line 2 belongs to the function defined in line 1, line 5 to line 4,
and the other lines are all at the same level.</p>
<p>Whether to use spaces or tabs in your scripts is a matter of personal preference. But be consistent, it makes it easier to copy and paste your code for reutilizing it.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title"><strong>Pound Sign, I (Finally) Love You</strong></p>
<p>If, like me, you never understood the reason for the number/pound sign key (#) on your phone, you will eventually find it very useful.
In Python, any text to the right of a pound sign is ignored by the interpreter. Therefore, the pound sign is used to add commentaries to your code
or to temporarily deactivate part of it.</p>

<h2>OOP - Object-Oriented Programming<a class="headerlink" href="#oop-object-oriented-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since games deal with 3D world objects, it makes sense to use a language that is oriented to them. The game engine itself is written in C++, a very strong and
object-oriented language, and Python OOP capabilities let you handle the game data in a Python-native way. It reflects in the game engine objects having their
own set of functions and variables directly accessed from a Python API (to be explained later in this chapter in the section “Using the Game Engine API - Application
Programming Interface”).</p>
<p>In the Python code, you can (and will) create your own classes, modules, and elements. For example, you may want to control some 3D elements as a group defined
by your code. It will make it easy to get to all of them at once. Therefore, you can have a custom class that will store all the related objects you want to access
and preserve some properties as a group.</p>
<p>Open the book file: BookChapter72_oopoop.blend</p>
<p>The first script that runs in this file is the init_world.py. Here we are creating two groups to store different kind of elements (cube and sphere).
In order to sort the objects between the groups, we go over the entire scene object list and check for objects with a property “cube” or “sphere” and append
them to their respective lists.</p>

<h2>Where to Learn Python<a class="headerlink" href="#where-to-learn-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have previous experience with another programming language, you will learn Python in no time. If you go over some basic Python tutorials,
look at some script examples, and check the Blender game engine API, that might be enough. But if learning Python is your first step into coding experience,
don’t worry. Take the time to read through the basics of the language, start with the simplest tasks, and never give up.</p>
<p>Usually, a good way to start is tweaking ready-to-use scripts, which doesn’t require you to understand all the aspects of the language before your first
experiments. Also, it gives you a good motivational boost by producing quick results for your efforts. We recommend you first learn Python and then focus on
its application in the game engine. But you may be more comfortable messing with game engine files first and then later learning Python more deeply.</p>
